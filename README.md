This repository gathers projects developed during my Python training:

[FizzBuzz_project.py]: displays Fizz/Buzz/FizzBuzz according to logic game rules.

[IMC_project.py]: BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator with user input validation.

[randomnumb_project_v0.1.py]: a first random number guessing game.

[random_number_v0.2.py]: improved version with error handling and replay option.

[rock_paper_scissors_project.py]: interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python, includes typo correction (difflib), random computer choice, and replay option.

[task_list_project.py]: object-oriented command-line to-do list manager. Add, complete, delete, and display tasks using a clear menu. Fully commented and beginner-friendly.

Usage:

Each script is standalone and can be launched with Python 3 (no additional dependencies required).
Simply follow the on-screen instructions in each program.

Goals:

My goal is to master the Python language as a whole, consolidating all essential basics and applying acquired knowledge to varied projects.

This repository illustrates the evolution of my skills throughout my training.
